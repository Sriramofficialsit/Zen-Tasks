Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1:
=========
1.Uses separate connections for each resource, leading to potential bottlenecks.
2.Headers are not compressed, causing overhead.
3.No built-in support for server push.
4.No prioritization of resources, potentially slowing down page load times.
5.Errors can interrupt the entire page loading process.

HTTP/2:
=======
1.Uses a single connection for multiple resources, reducing latency.
2.Compresses headers, reducing overhead.
3.Supports server push, improving performance.
4.Prioritizes resources, speeding up page load times.
5.Errors are isolated, minimizing impact on other resources.



write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript


Definition of an Object:
========================
An object is a collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are also called property names, and values can be any data type (including other objects).


Creating an Object:
===================
Use curly braces {} to create an object.
Add key-value pairs inside the braces.

let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false
};

Accessing Object Properties:
============================
Use dot notation:

console.log(person.name); // Output: John

Use bracket notation:

console.log(person["age"]); // Output: 30


Adding and Modifying Properties:
================================
Add a new property:

person.job = "Engineer";

Modify an existing property:

person.age = 31;

Internal Representation of Objects:
===================================

JavaScript engines use hash tables or dictionaries to store objects.
This allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of properties.
